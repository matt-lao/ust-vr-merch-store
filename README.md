# (Mock) VR Merchandise Store - University of St. Thomas 
The following is documentation on the Mock VR Merchandise Store that was designed as part of an emerging technologies conference and was
presented to the Board of Governors at the Opus College of Business. 

### Getting Started
To check out the virtual reality environment download the Spaital.io app on a compatitable virtual reality headset, and search for the `University St. Thomas Mock Merchandise Store`. It is a publicly avaiable space, however if Spatial changes how you naviagate to spaces and you need a manual invite, feel free to email me at [matthew.lao24@gmail.com](matthew.lao24@gmail.com).

On desktop, you can explore the space from a third person perspective at anytime by visiting this [link](https://www.spatial.io/s/Shop-6243c62ac40e940001b4b203?share=8455234183693210692). On some headsets, visiting this link will launch the Spatial app and take you to the space as well.

### Technologies
This Mock VR Merchandise Store was primarily created using [Spatial.io](https://www.spatial.io/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
